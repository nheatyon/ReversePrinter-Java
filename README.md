<h1 align="center">Reverse-Printer Java ‚úçÔ∏è</h1>

(Of course I am being ironic)

## Description

<i>Simple java program that allows you to make console prints via <b>HelloWorld("System.out.println")</b>. Nothing else unfortunately.</i><br/><br/>
If you have nothing to do in your life, you can add other classes that extend "ReversePrinter" so that you can create your own custom output. The implementation is quite simple and basic.
